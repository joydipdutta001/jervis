# Jervis ( Joydip's Environment Responded Virtually Interected System )

This is an chatbot which is able to interct to human and give the weather update that is coming from the real planted temperature and smoke sensors via Firebase Database and NodeMCU.
It can perform other operations like WebScrabing, Blog Reading, Music Playing, File Managements, WhatsApp Notifying and some other operations.
I will upload the complete version at the end of this year.
I am trying to do this on Raspbery Pi 3B+ platform.
